Junior Juggle started out as a [Ludum Dare entry](/blog/ludum-dare-46/), but I liked it enough to polish it up and add some more dangerous items to keep from falling on poor Junior. I also looked into integrating the Newgrounds API so if you play on there you can unlock some medals and might even get your score on the leaderboard!
