[Bodge Dall](https://miltage.itch.io/bodge-dall) was my entry for the SA Game Jam 2020, which I conceived and created in a span of 48 hours over one weekend.

It didn't win any of the categories, but it did get one or two honorable mentions, of which I am very proud!  
[You can read the winners announcement here.](https://itch.io/jam/sa-game-jam/topic/1037428/winners-announcement#post-2135842)

I really love how this game turned out and still return to it to play a round from time to time.
