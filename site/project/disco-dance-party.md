# About

This game was made in a week for the Free Lives Physics Jam 2023. The only constraint for the jam is that the game must use physics in some way.

For this jam I played around with ragdoll simulation and settled on this disco dancing rhythm game.

# Results

The game won the award for "Best Ragdoll Physics"! üèÜ
