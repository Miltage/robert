# About

This is a game about rolling dice. Every round, you have a target number to beat and the goal is to roll above that target. 
Earn cash by rolling high, then spend that cash on more dice or items that help you reach the goal.
Beat all 13 rounds to win the game!

# History

The prototype for this game was originally made in 72 hours for the [SA Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/sa-game-jam-2024). The theme for this year's jam was **Midnight Staircase**, which is a game design pattern that you have probably not heard of, but are almost certainly familiar with. It is a repeating section of a game (like a level or round) that provides the player with an increasing reward, but also an increase in risk. Importantly, the player can choose to exit at any time, or to continue trying their luck. Some good examples are _Blackjack_ or the TV gameshow _Deal or No Deal_.

After 2 hours of sitting on the couch staring out of the window, I came up with the concept of a very simple game about rolling dice. The player has to roll higher than a certain target number, and every round the target to beat rises a little, increasing the difficulty. The player earns money for rolling above the target, which can then be spent in a store to buy more dice or other upgrades.

The _Midnight Staircase_ part comes in during the actual roll itself. The player is able to reroll some or all of their dice, or stick with their current roll. They are incentivised to roll higher to not only beat the round, but also to earn more money. However, the risk is that they could roll lower and potentially lose the game. It's an interesting gamble on the player's part. 

The game was originally called "Fortuno".
