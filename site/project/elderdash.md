# About

This is a simple game I made about guiding a poor, sweet old granny across the road, dodging an array of traffic, trains and even a jet airliner!

*I'm so, so sorry.*

This small project was an entry to a [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/physics-game-jam-2021) for submissions that contained physics-based gameplay. This game was made with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) and was my first time experimenting with [ragdoll physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll_physics).

Originally going to be a game about stacking furniture like a some over-sized game of [Jenga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga), I switched tracks after crossing the road to buy snacks to munch on while I was working.

Fun fact: I almost called this game *Untitled Granny Game* and *Granny Mall Crossing* (Animal Crossing)
