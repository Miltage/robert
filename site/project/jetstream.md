Jetstream started out as Ludum Dare entry by [Francois van Niekerk](https://twitter.com/francoisvn). Back when I worked over at [Clockwork Acorn](http://clockworkacorn.com/) in 2017 we embarked on what is now a multi-year journey to transform that [prototype](https://francoisvn.itch.io/streamline) into a fully-fledged puzzle game.

After some delibertaion, we settled on a new (aeronatical) theme and added brand new mechanics as well as over 100 hand-crafted puzzles. After a few hurdles that stunted development, we eventually launched our first version on Steam in April 2019.

Some final features are still being developed for the mobile version.
