# About

I made this small game for the GMTK Game Jam 2023. This year's theme was **Role Reversed**. After an hour or two of thought, I came up with the idea of recreating a game from my childhood, but played from the perspective of the game's only antagonist - a giant Yeti that chases you down on the ski slopes and gobbles you up at the end of the game.

This game was made over a single weekend with the help of the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) and I streamed the entire process over on [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/miltage).

# Reception

Let me tell you, this game did freaking numbers! I was not expecting to go viral with this one but I think this little project hit people right in the nostalgia button and resonated with them because the tweet below was shared far and wide, racking up 335k views!
