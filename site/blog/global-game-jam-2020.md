"Boy, I sure do love my new Cybertruck!"  
~ Elon Musk (probably)

Global Gam Jam was here again last weekend, and though I'd partaken a few times before, this year I did things a little differently.

Usually, everyone (all the jammers, that is) meets at a predetermined location for the theme reveal. Once revealed, ideas are formed and pitches are made to the room in the hopes of recruiting team members to your brilliant (to you, at least) game idea.

This time, however, I had been chatting to Jonathan, a young, avid programmer, a few weeks prior. He had never done any game development before and was interested in learning, so I suggested we form our own little team of two and enter the jam. Super keen, he jumped at the idea and plans were quickly made for the weekend.

## Preparation

The apartment can get a little cramped if you're cooped up in there for too long, so I secured the offices of my company in Woodstock for us to jam in. It was there where we would be spending most of our time, going home only to sleep.

Having built Jetstream in Haxe for 3 years, this used to be my weapon of choice for game jams, considering my familiarity with the framework. This time around though I had just spent a week building a game prototype in Three.js and thought it would be a great idea to use it for the jam.

I made plans with Jono to meet the weekend before so we could set up a repo and boilerplate code, sparing us the time it would take to arrange those things during the jam. I also took this opportunity to help him familiarise himself with the technology a little.
