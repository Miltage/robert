The time has come to welcome in the new decade with an overhaul of my long-stagnant personal website.

My site has taken many shapes and forms over the previous decade. It started out as your standard run-of-the-mill WordPress blog/portfolio hybrid (back when WordPress was all the rage and every web developer worth their salt built, or had built, WordPress sites) before I decided to ditch the CMS concept altogether and code up my site in pure HTML and CSS like a proper programmer.

I moved the blog over to [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) (which I updated quite infrequently) and threw together a basic HTML template of which I was immensely proud. Every time I needed to add something to the site, I would open the HTML files, copy the relevant lines of code, insert the new values and upload that via FTP to my web server. *And that worked just fine.*

My site saw little traffic, except the odd occasion where I would self-host one of my [Ludum Dare](http://ldjam.com/) entries and give my sysadmin a heart attack (a friend hosted the site for me on his personal server). Still, every so often I would become bored of the layout, think I could do better and spend a few hours re-imagining how I would present the same 6 - 8 blocks of static content to the odd site-lander.

Around the end of 2016 my site saw more frequent updates as I picked up drawing again as a hobby and started posting those pencil sketches on my site too. I soon grew tired of copying and pasting the same 5 lines of HTML code with every single little addition to my site so I decided it would be a pretty cool thing indeed if my content could load from *external data files*. Then every update would be as easy as adding a line to a text file. What I'd just invented was a templating engine, but I didn't know that at the time. Chuffed with my new idea, I set about coding up my own templates in PHP.

This worked fine too, but I only used it for a few months before my life became too busy and any updates to my site became a low-priority. It sat on the shelf collecting dust for a year or two until some time late 2019 I randomly thought about it again. *Just how was my old friend doing these days?* It had been so long. I typed the address into my browser and was greeted with a page I didn't recognise. Somewhere along the way I had forgotten to renew my domain and it had expired, after which some company whose sole business it is to snatch up recently-expired domains had done exactly that. This was not good.

I reached out to the company via email and they agreed to sell my own domain back to me for a small fee (how kind...). Fortunately, my site had seen little traffic over the recent years and wasn't worth much to them anyway. I sent them the money and they signed the domain back over to me. Re-united, I decided it was long overdue that I gave my site a little overhaul. 

By this time I had learned of templating engines and static site generators. I had used [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build a site for a friend and after the initial setup, adding content was a cinch. Furthermore, GitHub now offered static hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so I could host this humble little site for free too!

*So here we are!* Chances are you're reading this on a completed and functional site. I'll write [another blog post](/blog/how-i-built-this-site) about the actual steps I took in the setting everything up so that people can follow and do the same if they like. This post was only intended to be a "breaking-in" post for the blog anyway (so I could test styling and navigation).

To you, reader: I hope that the new decade brings you all the happiness and successes that you deserve. Go forth and prosper!
