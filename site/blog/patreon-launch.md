Build a man a fire and he'll be warm for the night.  
Set a man on fire and he'll be warm for life.

I finally took the plunge and launched my own [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/miltage)!

I signed up on the platform years ago with the intention of using it but the account just laid dormant until now. In fact, it was so long that I actually [lost access to the account](https://twitter.com/miltage/status/1271312063965487105) but with lots of back and forth and help from the folks at Patreon support I managed to regain access to it.  
Anyone who becomes a patron can expect benefits such as: 

* Sneak peaks and previews
* Early access to works
* Patron-only Discord section
* Voting rights
* Free stuff! (includes large discounts and free copies/subscriptions to things as I release them)

I firmly believe in the value of hard work, and I am working every day to realise my dream of being a self-sufficient content creator. I am fully confident that with enough time and work I can achieve this dream on my own, but right now I am very dependent on my full time job, so any support from fans would put me one step closer to reaching my goal.

This pandemic has been tough on everyone financially, so if you don't have **$$$** to spare, no stress! I'll always be releasing stuff for free sooner or later.

Massive thanks in advance to anyone who does become a patron!
