Bleep bloop!

I started [streaming on Twitch](/blog/hello-twitch/) a little over a month ago and when I started, I saw no need for a bot. A few weeks later, however, I started streaming myself playing [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) games and found that I couldn't keep up with the submissions. Links to people's games were being lost in the chat. I quickly created a Google Form for people to submit their games to a spreadsheet, but I needed a bot to send the link to people upon request. I managed to set one up with very little effort on [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/), but being a programmer, I wanted to create my own.

When my brother was an avid streamer a couple years ago he had set up his own bot, aptly titled **Greg_the_butler**. Borrowing heavily from this idea, my own bot, **Butler_Boris**, was born!

Bot services like [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) and [Nightbot](https://nightbot.tv/) are incredibly useful and easy to use, and I'm sure you will find that they will more than likely fit the job you need doing but if, however, you are like me and love to tinker, then this post is for you!
